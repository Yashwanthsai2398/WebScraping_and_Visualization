This Python program uses web scraping to extract mobile phone listings from eBay, creating a structured DataFrame. It analyzes the data to identify gadgets with the highest and lowest prices, as well as those
with the highest and lowest ratings. It employs regular expressions to extract numerical information like ratings. The program visualizes the relationship between price and rating using Seaborn and Matplotlib,
displaying a bar graph in green to represent the analyzed data for quick and clear insights into the mobile phone listings' price-rating distribution.
